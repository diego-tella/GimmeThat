<h1>GimmeThat</h1>
GimmeThat is a program developed in C# for windows machines. When executed, the program will look for files of another users and copy them to the current directory. It can be useful when there are more users in the computer and you have Admin Privileges to copy all files at once. It can be pretty useful in red team engagement.

   <li>-google --> Get google folders</li>
   <li>-d --> Get document folders and files</li>
   <li>-p --> Get pictures folders and files</li>
